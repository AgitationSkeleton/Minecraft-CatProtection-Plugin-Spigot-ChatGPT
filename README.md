This is a plugin for Minecraft Spigot that makes all cats completely refuse any damage. The code was entirely created by ChatGPT and I claim none of it. In line with the other GPT-generated things I've posted I am only posting this for others to look at, modify or use as they see fit.

To use, simply place the .jar file in your Spigot plugins folder.
